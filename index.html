        <h2>To: My baby rayzel </h2>
        <p class="taglish">
          Baby, it’s already been two years — can you believe how fast time flies? Sometimes I still can’t process how far we’ve come. Within those two years, we’ve been through so much — endless laughter, happy memories, little arguments, misunderstandings, and even the moments when things felt heavy. But through it all, we stayed. We chose to hold on to each other.

I’ve seen how patient, consistent, and loving you are. You never fail to make me feel that I’m worth staying for. You’ve taught me what real love looks like, not the kind that’s always perfect or easy, but the kind that chooses to stay, to understand, and to keep loving even when things get hard.

There were days when I felt lost, when everything seemed too much, but you were there calm, steady, and still choosing me. And that means everything, baby. <br> <br> 

Two years may sound long, but honestly, it still feels short compared to how much more I want to spend with you. I know there’s still a long journey ahead more challenges, more laughter, more days to grow together but I’m ready to face all of that with you by my side.

I hope we stay this way: consistent, faithful, and growing together. Because I don’t just see you as someone I love now, I see you as the man I want to marry someday.

Thank you, baby, for loving me the way you do, for staying even when things get messy, and for always reminding me that love isn’t about perfection, but effort and choice.

I love you endlessly not just for who you are, but for who I’ve become because of you. You’re my comfort, my peace, and my home. And I’ll always choose you today, tomorrow, and for the rest of my life. 🤍
